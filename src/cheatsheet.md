### Basic Text Formatting

Use `<strong>` tags to signify important text like <strong>this</strong>:
```html
This is <strong>important</strong>.
```

Use `<em>` tags to emphasize text like <em>this</em>:
```html
This is <em>emphasized</em>.
```

Use a `<br>` to create a line break between text...<br>...This is a new line and note there is no "closing" tag for a `<br>`.
```html
This is line 1.<br>This is line 2.
```

To color a word, wrap the word(s) in a `span` tag and give the `<span>` one of the following classes.

This is <span class="red-text">red</span>.<br>
This is <span class="blue-text">blue</span>.
```html
This is <span class="red-text">red</span>.
This is <span class="blue-text">blue</span>.
```

### Lists

An ordered list tag (`<ol>`) uses numbers for each item.
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```

An unordered list tag (`<ul>`) uses filled in circles for each item.
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
