### Basic Text Formatting

These are a few basic `html` tags that can be used to change the look of text. The first 3 are native and the last one is a custom one created to change to Infor’s designated "alert red" color.
<hr>

<div class="example">This is <strong>important</strong>.</div>
```html
This is <strong>important</strong>.
```

<div class="example">This is <em>emphasized</em>.</div>
```html
This is <em>emphasized</em>.
```

<div class="example">This is line 1.<br>This is line 2.</div>
```html
This is line 1.<br>This is line 2.
```

<div class="example">This is a <span class="red-text">red word</span>.</div>
```html
This is a <span class="red-text">red word</span>.
```

### Lists

An ordered list tag (`<ol>`) uses numbers for each item. An unordered list tag (`<ul>`) uses filled in circles for each item.

<div class="example">
    <ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ol>
</div>
```html
<ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```

<div class="example">
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```
