# Styles and Documentation website for Pendo.io styling

To build the style guide and documentation website:

1. Clone the repo
1. `npm install`
1. Build/Serve
    - `gulp` = build
    - `gulp dev` = build & serve
    - `gulp serve:prod` = serve on port 80 for production (requires files to be built separately)
